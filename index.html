            <p>I see dead CSS selectors.</p>

        <p>
            This is just a demo to illustrate how this tool detects dead CSS selectors and displays
            them on the page.
        </p>

        <p>
            You'll notice the very first time the panel appears at the bottom (after 3 seconds), it
            will show <code>#dead-selectors</code> and a few other selectors that it thinks are
            dead, because on the first scan it didn't find these on the page. However, after
            <em>another</em> 3 seconds it will clear those selectors since they're being used by the
            very panel on which the results are displayed! This is an example of how this tool helps
            account for CSS rules that only apply to content that is added dynamically.
        </p>

        <p>
            After the panel updates, you should see two selectors that are "dead": one from a
            stylesheet, and one from <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element in the HTML of this page.
            You can also&mdash;in Firefox, at least&mdash;try adding custom CSS in the box above, to
            add more dead rules for the tool to detect.
